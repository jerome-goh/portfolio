## Projects in statistics and data science

### Project 1: Missing data analysis and imputation in R
This project aims to better understand how the characteristics of vehicles factor into greenhouse gas emissions based on the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) 2023 [data](https://www.epa.gov/compliance-and-fuel-economy-data/data-cars-used-testing-fuel-economy) on testing fuel economy. This dataset poses a unique challenge since deleting empty cells will result in the deletion of most of the data, thus calling the need for imputation to perform any analysis.

The objectives are to identify and understand missing data mechanisms, patterns of missingness, and estimate values of missing observations based on prior information from the remaining dataset. After which, we pick highly correlated predictors for the deployment of a multiple regression model to explain their effects on Carbon Dioxide emissions. 

### Project 2: Image classification w/. tuner models in TensorFlow
